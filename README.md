# React app for KaiOS Twilio Integration


This was cloned from [KaiOS Developer Portal](https://developer.kaiostech.com/getting-started/build-your-first-app/sample-code#react) as well as some react Converation Demos. 

Until this can be hosted, you need to copy .env-example and put in the appropriate twilio configs. 

The main reason I am exploring this is that I got a flip phone and it does not support keeping track of multi-party conversations.  Instead it treats it like a bunch of single messages.   While I got away with using Google Voice, React and Twilio is proving to be fun.

npm run start
# or
